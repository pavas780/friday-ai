Did you like Ironman and his ai Jarvis, here is the small but capable version of  Jarvis named Friday.
It can perform plenty of things like creating notes, opening games and some apps, playing music, set alarm,
search anything on google, playing youtube telling weather of anywhere, read newspaper for you, read pdf for you,
send email, send whatsapp message to anyone in your contact list, translate any word, do any  mathematical calculations and many more.
